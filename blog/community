What are blogging communities and why you should join it?
Basically, blogging communities are like social networks for bloggers. Where we can meet and interact with other bloggers, engage and drive a good amount of traffic to our blogs. Since blogging community members are real bloggers, we can share our thoughts and ideas with them.

There are hundreds of blogging communities, but only a few are good.
